## Quick Start

### Installation

**Prerequisites** (one-time):

- Node.js 22+
- Python 3.10+
- `pip3 install TTS torch torchaudio` — Voicci uses XTTS v2 locally (PyTorch + Coqui TTS; ~2 GB of model weights download on first run)

**Install the CLI:**

```bash
npm install -g voicci
```

**Verify everything is wired up:**

```bash
voicci doctor
```

`voicci doctor` prints a PASS/FAIL table for Node, Python, TTS, PyTorch, acceleration (MPS/CUDA/CPU), and the AI-editor skill directory. If anything fails, it tells you the exact command to fix it.

The npm package installs the CLI plus the Claude Code / OpenCode / Cursor / Windsurf skill files. **Restart your AI editor** after install so it picks up `/voicci`.

### Usage with AI Code Editors

#### Claude Code (Recommended)
```
/voicci Lord of the Rings
/voicci search "neural networks book"
/voicci summary mybook.pdf
```

Claude AI will:
- Search for books intelligently
- Handle ambiguity and pick the best match
- Monitor conversion progress
- Troubleshoot errors automatically
- Guide you through summarization

#### OpenCode
```
Find and convert "Attention Is All You Need" paper to audiobook
```

OpenCode will understand your intent and run the appropriate `voicci` commands.

#### Cursor / Windsurf / Other AI Editors

Simply tell your AI assistant what you want in natural language:
- "Convert this PDF to an audiobook"
- "Find me a book about machine learning and turn it into audio"
- "Summarize this paper for me"

The AI will intelligently use the `voicci` CLI commands to accomplish the task.

## Advanced Installation

### Alternative Install Methods

**One-Line Install Script:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://voicci.com/voicci-cli/install.sh | bash
```

**Manual Install from Source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/voicci/voicci-cli.git
cd voicci-cli
npm install
pip3 install TTS torch torchaudio
npm link
```

## CLI Reference (For Advanced Users)

These commands are typically run by your AI assistant, but you can also use them directly:

### Convert by Book Name (Recommended)

```bash
# Just name the book - Voicci finds and downloads it
voicci "The Great Gatsby"
voicci "Attention Is All You Need"  # Academic papers too!
voicci "1984 by George Orwell"
```

### Convert from File

```bash
# PDF or TXT file
voicci mybook.pdf
voicci story.txt
```

### Search Without Downloading

```bash
# Preview search results before downloading
voicci --search "The Catcher in the Rye"
```

### Generate Summaries

```bash
# Generate analytical summary only (no audio)
voicci summary mybook.pdf
voicci --summary "The Great Gatsby"

# Generate both audiobook AND summary
voicci --with-summary mybook.pdf
voicci --with-summary "1984"
```

**Summary Features**:
- Analytical style with clear, non-specialized vocabulary
- Retains specificity (key details, names, numbers, facts)
- Adaptive length: 2-5% of original word count depending on document size
- Three backends: Ollama (local LLM), Python AI, or extractive fallback
- Saves summary as text file with statistics

### Monitor Progress

```bash
# Live progress UI with chapter status
voicci -s <jobId>

# List all jobs
voicci -s
```

### Manage Audiobooks

```bash
# List completed audiobooks
voicci -l

# Open audiobook folder
voicci -o <jobId>

# Delete audiobook
voicci -d <jobId>

# Cancel running job
voicci --cancel <jobId>
```

### Configuration

```bash
# View current configuration
voicci config show

# Set memory profile (low, medium, high)
voicci config set-profile high

# Set quality preset (fast, balanced, best)
voicci config set-quality balanced

# Toggle memory monitoring
voicci config set-monitoring on

# View system recommendations
voicci config recommend

# Check memory status
voicci memory
```

## How It Works

### Audiobook Generation

1. **Search & Download** - Finds book from LibGen, Anna's Archive, or other sources
2. **Text Extraction** - Extracts clean text from PDF or reads text file
3. **Smart Cleaning** - Removes noise (page numbers, headers, footers, TOC)
4. **Chapter Detection** - Identifies chapter boundaries automatically
5. **Sentence Splitting** - Breaks text into sentences for natural prosody
6. **Audio Generation** - XTTS v2 generates high-quality speech
7. **Background Processing** - Runs independently with persistent queue
8. **Progress Tracking** - Real-time CLI UI shows status

### Summary Generation

1. **Text Extraction** - Same extraction and cleaning as audiobook generation
2. **Length Calculation** - Determines target word count (2-5% based on document size)
3. **AI Processing** - Uses Ollama (local LLM), Python AI, or extractive summarization
4. **Quality Assurance** - Ensures analytical style with clear language
5. **Output** - Saves summary as text file with statistics and metadata

## Book Sources

Voicci searches multiple sources automatically:

1. **Library Genesis** - Largest collection of academic books
2. **Anna's Archive** - Comprehensive shadow library
3. **Z-Library** - Alternative source (requires auth)

All sources are accessed via scripted HTTP requests (no APIs, no credentials).

## Configuration System

Voicci features a smart configuration system that automatically optimizes settings based on your hardware.

### Memory Profiles

| Profile | RAM | Max File | Jobs | Monitoring | Best For |
|---------|-----|----------|------|------------|----------|
| **low** | 2-4GB | 50MB | 1 | Enabled | Budget laptops, older machines |
| **medium** | 4-8GB | 100MB | 2 | Enabled | Typical consumer laptops |
| **high** | 8GB+ | 500MB | 5 | Disabled | Modern machines, workstations |

```bash
# View available profiles
voicci config profiles

# Switch profile
voicci config set-profile medium
```

### Quality Presets

| Preset | Speed | Quality | Best For |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| **fast** | Fastest | Good | Testing, drafts |
| **balanced** | Medium | Very Good | Recommended (default) |
| **best** | Slower | Excellent | Final audiobooks |

```bash
# View available presets
voicci config presets

# Switch preset
voicci config set-quality best
```

### Memory Monitoring

Optional monitoring that warns when memory usage is high:

- **Auto-enabled**: On low/medium profiles (systems with <8GB RAM)
- **Auto-disabled**: On high profile (systems with 8GB+ RAM)

```bash
# Enable monitoring
voicci config set-monitoring on

# Disable monitoring
voicci config set-monitoring off

# Check current status
voicci memory
```

### Configuration File

Settings are stored in `~/.config/voicci/settings.json` (XDG Base Directory compliant):

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "memoryProfile": "high",
  "qualityPreset": "balanced",
  "autoDetectProfile": true,
  "enableMemoryMonitoring": null,
  "profileManuallySet": false,
  "customSettings": {}
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Python version error

Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### Model download fails

Check internet connection during installation. Model (~450MB) is downloaded once.

### PDF not extracting

Install poppler-utils for pdftotext:

```bash
# macOS
brew install poppler

# Linux
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```

### Metal not available

Requires macOS 12+ on Apple Silicon. Falls back to CPU if unavailable.

### Book search failing

Sources may be temporarily unavailable. Try:

1. Different book title or author name
2. Using file path directly: `voicci mybook.pdf`
3. Checking internet connection

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Start worker manually
npm run worker

# Test text cleaner
node tests/test-cleaner.js

# Check queue status
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/voicci/queue.db "SELECT * FROM jobs;"
```
